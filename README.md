# Development Interventions and Health
 
This session will provide an introduction to the various types of development interventions and discuss the implications they have for health using 3 empirical case studies:

1. The Productive Safety Nets Project (PSNP) in Ethiopia which aims to enable the rural poor facing chronic food insecurity to resist shocks, create assets and become food self-sufficient;

2. Large-scale food fortification programme in Rajasthan state, India which aims to fortify wheat, oil and milk at-scale to reduce micronutrient deficiencies in the population of Rajasthan such as Vitamin A deficiency among children aged 6 to 59 months and among women.

3. The Child Development Grant Programme (CDGP) in Nigeria that aims to reducing widespread poverty, hunger and malnutrition through unconditional cash transfer and behaviour change communication (BCC).

## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. Describe different kinds of development interventions that have implications for health

2. Critically appraise how such interventions affect health

3. Outline the mechanisms for both the intended and unintended consequences of the intervention for health
